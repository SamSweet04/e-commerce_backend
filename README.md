# Golang final project
##### Will wrap it with docker and add RBAC later until 05.05.2023, *promise

## To run this project on your machine right now:
1. Clone this project
2. Create .env file in the root folder
3. Create database locally on postgres
4. Fill out the .env file in this format: <br>
  DB_HOST=localhost <br>
  DB_USER=asylniet <br>
  DB_PASSWORD=1234 <br>
  DB_NAME=golang_final <br>
  
Then it should connect to local postgres and run the project. Please check all the tables, so that it correctly made connections with foreign keys

##### Thanks
